### CreWork Month-3 Week-2 Assignment

## Challenge- GitHub App using React.JS

Now this week, we will learn React.JS by creating a simple GitHub App using GitHub API.


#### React.JS :
1. React is a widely used JS Library to build user interfaces.
2. With the help of React, we can build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
3. Also, React is declarative.

Okay for the introduction, lets build our project😎
